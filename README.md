# SkillsRobot
Base Code for Craig Kielberger Secondary School Halton Skills Robotics Team. 

This Arduino code contains a class to drive two continius servo motors and enables the use of a gripper using a regular servo motor.

In addition to driving, this code also further simplifies the PixyCam (http://charmedlabs.com/default/pixy-cmucam5/) API, and allows for quick and easy vision processing on Arduino
